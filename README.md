# MBA Python

This repository is dedicated to all the MBA students who probably want to know what
the heck coding is and sort of want to know how to do it. At least enough so that when
those jerk engineers start talking smart and stuffs they can understand it.

## Docs

The [documentation](./docs) directory. This will contain all the necessary documentation
on how to run any specific tutorials and how to download/install any packages.

## Tutorials

The [tutorials](./tutorials) directory. This will contain all the tutorials on high level
programming and python content that will help you as a business student get off the ground
running.

## Stats

Inspired by [`tprstats`](https://github.com/dnepple/tprstats) a package written by one of our 
statistics professors at Carnegie Mellon University. This will attempt  to take a high level 
approach to statistics and provide a helpful python package for performing typical statistics
operations.
